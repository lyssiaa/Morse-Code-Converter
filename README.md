Morse-Code-Converter

This repository contains the VHDL code for a fully functional keyboard-to-speaker Morse code converter, developed as the final project for ENGS 31: Digital Electronics (24X). The project, created in collaboration with a partner, runs on an FPGA and translates keyboard input into Morse code, which is then output as sound through a speaker. The system uses UART protocol to handle communication between the keyboard and the computer, and SPI protocol to interface with the speaker. This project demonstrates a complete digital design pipeline, showcasing the use of hardware description languages and peripheral communication protocols to build an efficient Morse code translator.
