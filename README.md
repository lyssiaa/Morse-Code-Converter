Morse-Code-Converter

This repository contains all the code for my final project in ENGS 31: Digital Electronics (24X). In collaboration with my project partner, we developed a fully functional keyboard-to-speaker Morse code converter implemented on an FPGA. The system uses the UART protocol for communication between the keyboard and the computer, and the SPI protocol for controlling the speaker. The project integrates digital design techniques to create an efficient and reliable Morse code translator, converting keyboard input into audible Morse code output.
